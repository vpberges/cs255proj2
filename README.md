# CS 255: Proejct 2 â€“ Secure CURL
This is the second project in CS 255, "Introduction to Cryptography" taught by Dan Boneh at Stanford University. In this project we implement a secure version of the curl command line utility which is used for fetching HTTP content from a URL. This project is implemented in PYthon 2.7 and makes use of the pyOpenSSL library.

## Installation
Run `pip pyopenssl` in terminal to install the OpenSSL library

Give permission to `scurl` by running  `chmod +x scurl`

## How to use
Just like how you would use curl:

`$ ./scurl [options] [URL...]`

for example

`$ ./scurl --ciphers DHE-DSS-AES256-SHA:DH-RSA-AES256-SHA https://www.stanford.edu/`


## Project TODO list
1. Confirm hostname from returned certificate
2. Implement SNI
    a. Send hostname during TLS client Hello message at connection setup
    b. Also check to make sure that the hostname matches during verify
3. Parse malformed URLs i.e. https://www.example.com/
4. Allow user to specify port number
5. Figure out how to get it to stop reading/timeout when no message ending is sent
6. Check the SHA-256 hash for pinnedcertificate comparison
7. Make --cacert override --crlfile
8. Test everything extensively
